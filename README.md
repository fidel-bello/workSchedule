# general information 
* this week's project was to make create simple same day calendar for each of a working day. The app features dynamilly updated html and css powered by jquery.
* I used moment. js to set date/time in the file. 
* when the user opens the calendar, the calendar displays the current date and hour. if the user texts in the blocks and clicks the save button it will save the text that was inputted. The app will display color of the blocks if it is in the past (grey) present (red )  or future (red). if the page is refreshed, the saved user input will still be available.
